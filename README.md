# ðŸ“„ Project 5: HTML Lists, Forms, and Buttons â€” *The Clickbait Collection*

Welcome to **Project 5** of my Web Development journeyâ€”where structure meets style and buttons abound (even if they donâ€™t always *do* much)! This project showcases foundational HTML elements like lists, images, tables, and forms. Itâ€™s the digital playground where I learned to make my web pages more interactive and structured, even if most of the buttons are just here for the *aesthetic*.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**Objective:**  
To learn and implement HTML elements including:
- Lists (`<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<dl>`)
- Tables (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`)
- Images (`<img>`)
- Forms (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`, etc.)

**Status:** Completed  
**Warning:** Clicking buttons may lead to *absolutely nothing*. Enjoy the illusion of interactivity.

## ðŸ§© Whatâ€™s Inside?

### ðŸ“‹ Lists
Mastered three types of HTML lists:
- **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)**: With custom starting points and list types.
- **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)**: Styled with various bullet types.
- **Definition Lists (`<dl>`)**: Used for pairing terms with definitions in a clean, structured layout.

### ðŸ–¼ Images
Embedded images with `src`, `alt`, `title`, and adjusted their dimensions to make sure they don't take over the page (or your sanity).

### ðŸ“Š Tables
Created a responsive table with:
- A **caption** for clarity
- **Headers**, **data rows**, and a **footer**
- Demonstrated a complete use of table elements, from `<thead>` to `<tfoot>`

### ðŸ“® Forms
Built a fully-fledged form collecting:
- Text
- Email
- Password
- Radio buttons for gender
- Checkboxes for hobbies
- A dropdown for country selection
- A text area for additional info

Includes buttons for **register**, **submit**, and **reset**, although againâ€”donâ€™t expect backend magic just yet.
