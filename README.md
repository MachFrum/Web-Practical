# 📸 HTML Div Pexels Recreation (Attempt 1): *Organized Chaos*

A bold attempt at recreating the visual spirit of [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) using only HTML and CSS. This project is less a polished clone and more a tribute to modern web chaos—glitchy, glorious, and occasionally functional.

At its heart, it's a responsive, grid-based image and video gallery that loads media dynamically and leans into the experimental aesthetic of form meeting entropy.

## 🎯 Project Goal

To understand grid layouts, media responsiveness, and HTML5 video/image rendering—all while crafting a gallery that walks the tightrope between usability and abstract art.

---

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Fully responsive layout using `div`s  
- 🖼️ Lazy-loaded images for better performance  
- 🎞️ Embedded autoplaying video content (muted & looped)  
- 📐 Organized in a grid-style layout for a pseudo-gallery effect  
- 🎭 Embraces imperfections as part of the aesthetic  

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS (linked externally; adjust path as needed)  
- Native video and image tags  
- No JavaScript (for now—raw chaos only)

## 📂 File Structure

```
/Creating Pexels
│
├── index.html             # Main gallery file (this one)
├── /Styles
│   └── Styles.css         # Custom CSS file (update local path)
```

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the files.
2. Make sure your CSS file is correctly linked.
3. Open `index.html` in your browser.
4. Watch the madness load—sometimes slowly, sometimes gloriously.

## 🖌️ Inspiration

Inspired by the curated, polished world of Pexels—but through the lens of a developer's first attempt to control the uncontrollable. Think of it as a digital collage where structure and disorder shake hands.

## 🤔 Final Thoughts

This is **Attempt 1** of what may or may not become a more polished clone. Or maybe it stays wild forever. Either way, the images *do* load... eventually.
